<h1>prvi naslov</h1>
<p>  Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, grap
    hic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown ty <br>  pesetter in the 15th century wh
    o is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type 
    specimen book. It usually begins with: <br>

    <span id="span1"> “Lorem ipsum dolor sit <br> amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod 
    tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqu <br> a.”</span>
    The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very us
    eful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content. </p>
